# Michael French Type and Interaction Project 04
## Links
### This is a project for type and interaction class focused on creating an interactive, responsive webpage that displays external content from Are.na. We used Are.na as our CMS for this project, and used Javascript to import content via the Are.na API. CSS and Javascript were also used to set up interactions and style the page.

### Theme - Staying in Style:
The original Are.na channel was curated by Soko Mungunsukh, and it explores the concept of “style” as inner logic rather than an external aesthetic, inspired by Charles Bukowski’s poem "Style."
